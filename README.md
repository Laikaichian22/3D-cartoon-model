# 3D-cartoon-model

This project focuses on the creation of a 3D cartoon using 3D objects. The transformation functions are applied on the cartoon model to allow the movements such as move forward, rotate hands, and others. 
The cartoon model is placed inside a scene with several features. The projection view can move around the scene based on the commands made by the user and there are several special features available by pressing on the dedicated keys.
